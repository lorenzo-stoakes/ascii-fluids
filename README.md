# ASCII Fluid Mechanics

This is a deobfuscation and analysis effort for the 2012 entry in the [IOCCC Obfuscated C Code Contest][ioccc] by [Yuseke Endoh][endoh] - take a look at this [amazing video][vid] of his work.

The [original source code][source-obfus] is available at the [entry page][source] along with a [hint page][source-hint] that provides details on the problem and a (somewhat) [deobfuscated version][source-deobfus] of the code.

All code here is an adaption of Yuseke's work and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0][cc] [license][cc-lic].

Note that all the text files (extension `.txt`) included in this repo are taken directly from the challenge source for testing convenience.

To compile and run this code, run the following:-

```bash
make test
```
